## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JavaServletExample.git
   cd JavaServletExample
   ```

2. **Install Java**:
   - Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (Java 8 or higher).

3. **Install Apache Tomcat**:
   - Download and install Apache Tomcat from [Apache Tomcat's official website](https://tomcat.apache.org/).

4. **Compile the Java Files**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the `src/main/java` directory.
   - Compile the Java files:
     ```bash
     javac -d ../../../../webapp/WEB-INF/classes com/example/*.java
     ```

5. **Deploy to Tomcat**:
   - Copy the entire `webapp` directory to the `webapps` folder of your Tomcat installation.

6. **Start Tomcat**:
   - Start the Tomcat server by running the `startup.sh` (Linux/Mac) or `startup.bat` (Windows) script located in the `bin` directory of your Tomcat installation.

## Usage
1. Open a web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/JavaServletExample/index.html
   ```
2. Interact with the forms to test the functionality:
   - Click the "Get Welcome Message" button to see a basic servlet response.
   - Use the login form to validate user credentials.
   - Create a session by entering a username.

## Servlets and Filters
- **BasicServlet**: Handles GET requests and displays a welcome message.
- **LoginServlet**: Validates user credentials and forwards to the welcome page or redirects back with an error.
- **SessionServlet**: Manages user sessions and stores the username.
- **WelcomeServlet**: Displays a welcome message to the logged-in user.
- **LoggingFilter**: Logs every request with IP address and timestamp.
- **AuthenticationFilter**: Restricts access to protected pages unless the user is logged in.

Certainly! Below is a detailed explanation of the core concepts related to Java Servlets as outlined in your assignment objective, along with descriptions of the relevant files in your project.

### **Core Concepts of Java Servlets**

#### **1. CGI vs Servlets**
- **Common Gateway Interface (CGI)**:
  - A standard for interfacing external applications with web servers.
  - Each request creates a new process, which can lead to performance issues.
  - Typically written in languages like Perl or Python.

- **Java Servlets**:
  - Java-based server-side technology that extends the capabilities of servers.
  - Servlets run within a servlet container (like Tomcat) and handle multiple requests in a single process, improving performance.
  - They provide better integration with Java applications and access to Java libraries.

#### **2. Servlet API**
- A set of classes and interfaces provided by Java for developing servlets.
- Key classes include:
  - `HttpServlet`: Base class for handling HTTP requests.
  - `ServletRequest`: Interface for request information.
  - `ServletResponse`: Interface for response information.

#### **3. HttpServletRequest & HttpServletResponse**
- **HttpServletRequest**:
  - Represents the request made by the client to the server.
  - Provides methods to retrieve request parameters, headers, and attributes.
  
- **HttpServletResponse**:
  - Represents the response that the servlet sends back to the client.
  - Provides methods to set response status, headers, and content type.

#### **4. ServletConfig & ServletContext**
- **ServletConfig**:
  - Provides configuration information to a specific servlet.
  - Allows servlets to read initialization parameters defined in the `web.xml` file.

- **ServletContext**:
  - Represents the entire web application context.
  - Allows servlets to share data and resources across the application.

#### **5. Session Management**
- Mechanism to maintain state across multiple requests from the same client.
- Techniques include:
  - **Cookies**: Small pieces of data stored on the client’s browser.
  - **URL Rewriting**: Appending session IDs to URLs.
  - **HttpSession API**: A built-in API for managing user sessions.

#### **6. RequestDispatcher**
- An interface that allows servlets to forward requests to other resources (like another servlet or JSP) or include content from other resources in the response.
- Useful for implementing a login system where a successful login forwards to a welcome page.

#### **7. Filters**
- Objects that perform filtering tasks on either the request to a resource, the response from a resource, or both.
- Common uses include logging, authentication, and input validation.

### **Detailed Information about Project Files**

#### **1. BasicServlet.java**
- Handles GET requests and displays a welcome message.
- Demonstrates the use of `HttpServletRequest` to retrieve parameters.

#### **2. ConfigServlet.java**
- Reads initialization parameters from `web.xml` using `ServletConfig`.
- Demonstrates how to access application-wide data using `ServletContext`.

#### **3. LoginServlet.java**
- Validates user credentials submitted via a login form.
- Uses `RequestDispatcher` to forward requests to the welcome page or redirect back with an error message.

#### **4. SessionServlet.java**
- Manages user sessions by storing the username in the session.
- Demonstrates session tracking using the `HttpSession` API.

#### **5. WelcomeServlet.java**
- Displays a personalized welcome message to the user based on the session data.
- Shows how to retrieve session attributes.

#### **6. LoggingFilter.java**
- Implements a filter that logs request details (IP address, timestamp, requested URL).
- Demonstrates how to use the `Filter` interface to intercept requests.

#### **7. AuthenticationFilter.java**
- Implements a filter that restricts access to certain resources unless the user is authenticated.
- Checks session attributes to determine if the user is logged in.

#### **8. web.xml**
- The deployment descriptor for the web application.
- Configures servlets, servlet mappings, and filters.
- Defines initialization parameters and context parameters.

#### **9. index.html**
- The frontend HTML file that provides forms for user interaction.
- Allows users to submit data to the servlets and view responses.

### **Conclusion**
This project provides a comprehensive understanding of Java Servlets and their core concepts through practical implementation. Each file plays a crucial role in demonstrating how servlets work, how to manage sessions, and how to handle requests and responses effectively. By completing this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience with Java web application development.
